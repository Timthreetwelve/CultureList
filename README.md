Culture List will display a subset of the culture information found in `System.Globalization.CultureInfo`. I built the application to be able to quickly look up information such as date and number formats and the correct local spelling of a language name. I created this repo in hopes that someone  working on localization might find it useful.

## Features
- Select from Specific Cultures, Neutral Cultures, or All Cultures
- Choose to have the Display Name, the Native Name or the English Name to display next to the Language Code
- Select a culture to display details. See screenshots.
- Choose a font that works best for you.
- Quickly filter the list
- Easily copy text
