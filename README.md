# CultureList

Culture List will display a subset of the culture information found in `System.Globalization.CultureInfo`. I built the application to be able to quickly look up information such as date and number formats and the correct local spelling of a language name.

## Features
- Select from Specific CUltures, Neutral Cultures, or All Cultures
- Choose to have the Display Name, the Native Name or the English Name to display next to the Language Code
-  Select a culture to display details. See screenshots.
-  Quickly filter the list
-  Easily copy text
